Drupal Commerce
===============

FedEx for Drupal Commerce provides direct FedEx integration with your
Drupal Commerce 2.x e-commerce site on Drupal 8.

Supporting all FedEx shipping services and an increasing number 
of FedEx's special services, such as Hazardous Materials and Dry Ice,
FedEx for Drupal Commerce is designed to be your one-stop solution 
for all of your FedEx shipping requirements.

Until FedEx for Drupal Commerce is enters the Beta phase, there will 
*not* be a guaranteed upgrade path between versions. We are doing our
best to minimize disruption (we're using it in production already!), 
but pay close attention during upgrades as there may be cases where 
you will have to reinstall the module.

Please report bugs in the [issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/commerce_fedex?version=8.x).
